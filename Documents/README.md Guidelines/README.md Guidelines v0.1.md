# README.md Guidelines

## What to include (some of which are optional)

* Product name or project title
* Summary (features, limitations, development backgrounds)
* Screenshots and demos
* Installation
* Archive directory URL
* .NET runtime URL
* Usage
* License & pricing (which is usually free)
* Supported platforms
* Repository URL
* User support
* Contact info

## Checks

* All major features are introduced
* The images are displayed correctly
* The URLs work and are correct
* Read through the whole thing as an user/customer and ask, "What else would I want to know?"

## Rules

A lot of README.md's contain redundant info. They are often not well-formed and the info is disoriented.

But README.md is not the product or the service. Its sole purpose is helping the users/customers get to know about the app comfortably.

It doesnt have to be filled with technical terms or be formed precisely like a thesis. Rather, it has to be easy and natural to read through.

So, try and make it easy and friendly.
