# Yoshinao Inoguchi

I got hooked on programming at 14, passed the national IT examination at 16, entered university at 18 but found it uninteresting since I was already proficient in IT so I dropped out. I then started to wander abroad, working in software development and management consulting. Recognizing my achievements, I was admitted to a graduate school which turned out to be interesting, so I graduated, but never used my degree. Since 2015, I have been a jack-of-all-trades at a Spanish chandelier manufacturer. By the way, I am Japanese.

I successfully exhibited at exhibitions in Milan in 2017 and 2019, but since 2020, things have become difficult due to the Corona pandemic (no one buys luxury items in a recession), and I have been making a comeback from 2022. Now, I am working on expanding my business in a state with no debt and some internal reserves.

Also, because my father runs a logistics and manufacturing company in Japan, I'm exploring what I can do in those fields. I don't have the same talent as my father and doing the same thing as him would probably bankrupt the company. Therefore, I'm looking for a related business that only I can do, with uniqueness and high added value.

My strengths are global business and programming.

My weaknesses are low communication skills, always ordering large portions when I go to a ramen restaurant, spending too much money on stationery, being afraid of my wife, and being completely controlled by my daughter. I even joined the PTA because I'm too much of a doting parent.

I have residences in Valencia, Moscow, and Osaka. At the moment, I live in Osaka. My wife is Russian. When we got married, Japan-Russia relations were good. Currently, I don't have any work with Japanese corporations or individuals. For a while, I would like to take on challenges in BRICS and ASEAN. If I accumulate knowledge there, I might be able to help Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises expand overseas.

I'm still in the development phase and not yet in the communication phase, so I don't use social media much. However, I've decided to manage the following accounts, so please follow them for now.

For me, Facebook serves as a business card. I write about business on LinkedIn. I handle updates in English on X and in Japanese on Threads. I will also undertake the #100DaysOfCode challenge on these two platforms. If we have anything in common, don't hesitate to reach out. Even if we don't, let's start by following each other!
