Then, @popperjs is added. Probably, one or more of the packages now depend on it. The validation variant of jQuery also comes with localization-related files. Currently, I'm not sure if I need them. So, they are not copied to the lib directory. If I eventually need them, modifying a few lines of the script should get them working."
