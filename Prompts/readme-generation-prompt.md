# README Generation Prompt

This file contains modular prompts to improve project documentation. Use each section independently or together as needed.

## Overview

Three separate tasks are available:
1. Generate a README.md from project specifications
2. Create a Japanese translation of an existing README
3. Update .csproj file descriptions

---

## Task 1: Generate README.md

Generate a README.md for this project based on the most recent specification file.

Guidelines:
- Adapt structure to the specific project needs
- Include relevant sections only (Overview, Features, Configuration, etc.)
- Summarize technical content in clean prose or bullet points
- Use neutral, concise, developer-focused language
- Avoid code dumps, emojis, badges, and marketing language
- Target audience is developers familiar with .NET ecosystems

Focus on clearly communicating the project's purpose, structure, and behavior.

## Task 2: Create Japanese README

Create README.ja.md based on the current README.md file.

Guidelines:
- Use natural Japanese expression, not literal translation
- Preserve all core technical information and meaning
- Adapt content appropriately for Japanese developers
- Overwrite existing Japanese README if present

---

## Task 3: Update Project Descriptions

Update the Description element in .csproj files with concise summaries.

Guidelines:
- Create single-line descriptions (100-150 characters)
- For applications: Focus on purpose and target users
- For libraries: Highlight functionality and capabilities
- For other projects: Emphasize relevant technical aspects
- Use clear, direct language with appropriate terminology
- Focus on technical function rather than marketing
