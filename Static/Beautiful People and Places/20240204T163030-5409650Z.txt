An image of a handsome South Asian man with a gentle smile, dressed casually. He is sitting on a wooden bench, engrossed in reading a book. He is in a serene public garden filled with blooming cherry blossoms, quaint stone paths winding through lush greenery, and a classic wrought-iron fence surrounding the garden. To complete the scene, a small tranquil pond reflecting the vivid colours of the sky during a sunset can be seen nearby.
