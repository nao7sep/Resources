Create a striking image of a South Asian woman standing in a peaceful Japanese garden during cherry blossom season. She is wearing a traditional kimono in vibrant colors of blue and gold, with realistic patterns of chrysanthemums and peacocks. The woman is caught in a calm, serene pose, admiring the dense flurry of pale pink cherry blossoms that fill the sky and sweep the ground around her. A small gentle stream flows nearby, with the delicate reflection of cherry blossoms on its surface. Traditional stone lanterns add a touch of tranquil elegance to the scene.
