Illustrate a Middle-Eastern woman with long, curly hair, in a lush green garden filled with a variety of multicolored flowers. She is wearing a flowing pastel dress, and she's seated on an ornate wrought-iron bench under a blossoming cherry tree, engrossed in reading a Victorian-styled novel. The sun is setting, casting warm golden light over the scene. Peacocks can be seen in the background, roaming freely. The tranquility and scenic beauty of the place are truly captivating.
