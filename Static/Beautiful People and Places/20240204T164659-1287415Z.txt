Create an image of a South Asian woman with long, wavy hair, dressed in colourful, traditional attire, standing on a bridge over a serene lotus pond. The scene is enveloped in the warm glow of sunset, painting the sky in hues of purple, orange, and red. The calm water reflects the vibrant colours of the sky and lily pads float gently on the water surface. In the near distance, traditional stone lanterns line the path along the pond, their soft light contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. To complete the scene, cherry blossom trees in full bloom border the pond, their petals creating a delightful pink carpet on the ground.
