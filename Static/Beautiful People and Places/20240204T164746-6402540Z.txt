An elegant Middle Eastern woman, with dark, flowing hair and deep brown eyes, is lounging in a serene, lush garden. The sunlight streams through the green foliage, illuminating the vivid flowers that surround her. A gentle breeze ruffles her clothes, adding an ethereal touch. Nearby, colorful peacocks strut regally, their iridescent feathers glistening. With a peaceful expression, she is lost in the beauty of the nature around her.
