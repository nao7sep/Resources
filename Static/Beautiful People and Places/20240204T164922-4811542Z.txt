An attractive South Asian woman standing against the backdrop of majestic Himalayan mountain range, radiant in the colors of sunrise. She is elegantly dressed in a saffron colored saree with golden embellishments. Her dark hair is adorned with a traditional maang tikka. A cool morning breeze gently sways her hair and saree, adding a sense of motion to the entire scene.
