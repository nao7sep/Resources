An elegant South Asian woman in a flowing yellow sarong stands beside a Middle-Eastern man, smartly dressed in a casual blue suit. They are situated in a soothing landscape featuring an enchanting waterfall cascading over moss-covered rocks and a crystalline lake shimmering in the soft glow of the setting sun. The calm ambiance is further heightened by the presence of majestic 300-year-old Cypress trees, while vibrant wildflowers dot the surroundings, and birds of exquisite plumage dart across the sky.
