Visualize an East Asian woman, poised gracefully as she stands under the subtle shade of cherry blossom trees in full bloom. The soft pink petals showering around her, she wears a delicate blue silk dress that complements her complexion, while her long, raven-black hair is tied back in a loose bun. The backdrop exudes the serenity of a traditional Japanese tea garden, with a stone lantern partially hidden amidst the flora, neatly trimmed bushes, and a small pond mirroring the picturesque scenery. The gentle hues of the sunset paint this tranquil canvas with warm tones.
