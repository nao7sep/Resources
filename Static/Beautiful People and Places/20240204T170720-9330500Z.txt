An elegant South Asian woman with long, dark hair, dressed in a traditional saree, standing next to a serene, teal blue lake nestled amidst the lush greenery of a harmonious, idealistic forest. Sunlight peeping through the broad leaves of towering trees, casting dapples of soft light against her peaceful expression as a gentle breeze dances gently, causing the leaves to rustle and the surface of the lake to shimmer beneath the azure sky.
