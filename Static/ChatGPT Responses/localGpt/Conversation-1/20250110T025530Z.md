Below is a sample JSON-based schema (in pseudocode) that captures the main concepts you’ve described. It is intended to be flexible yet explicit about each piece of information you’d like to persist and restore later. Feel free to adapt naming conventions, optional fields, etc. to suit your exact needs.

```jsonc
{
  "ConversationId": "string or GUID if you need to identify this conversation uniquely",

  // System messages that are prepended to the conversation each time you call the API.
  // These MUST NOT be interspersed between user <-> assistant messages.
  "SystemMessages": [
    {
      "Content": "string (the system directive or instruction #1)"
    },
    {
      "Content": "string (the system directive or instruction #2)"
    }
    // ...
  ],

  // Finished interactions from previous sessions.
  // Each element in this list represents one question-answer cycle that is fully complete.
  "PreviousInteractions": [
    {
      "Prompt": {
        "Content": "User's text prompt or query",
        "Type": "text" // or "image" if the user asked for an image
      },
      "Response": {
        "Type": "text", // "text" | "image" | "error"
        "Content": "string or image URL/ID or error message"
      },
      // Optional: keep timestamps, usage, or other metadata
      "Timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:34:56Z"
    },
    // ...
  ],

  // The current interaction is “in progress.” It may contain multiple attempts if
  // the user has tried re-prompting or changing the prompt before concluding.
  "CurrentInteraction": {
    "Attempts": [
      {
        "Prompt": {
          "Content": "User's prompt #1 for the current interaction",
          "Type": "text" // or "image"
        },
        "Response": {
          "Type": "text", // "text" | "image" | "error"
          "Content": "Assistant's response (or error message, or image info)"
        },
        "Timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:40:00Z"
      },
      {
        "Prompt": {
          "Content": "User's prompt #2 for the same interaction (maybe user re-tries)",
          "Type": "text"
        },
        "Response": {
          "Type": "error",
          "Content": "Some error message from OpenAI"
        },
        "Timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:41:30Z"
      }
      // ...
    ]
  },

  // This captures the user's draft (the text currently in the input box).
  // The user may still be typing or has typed but not yet submitted it as an "attempt."
  "UserDraft": {
    "Content": "User is halfway done typing a question...",
    "Type": "text" // or "image"
  }
}
```

### Explanation / What Each Part Represents

1. **ConversationId**
   A unique identifier (e.g., a GUID) in case you want to track or load multiple conversations.

2. **SystemMessages**
   - An array of any number of “system instructions” that you always prepend to the actual user content whenever you send a request to OpenAI.
   - Kept separate so that no new system messages can be inserted *between* user messages (which would undermine the conversation’s objectivity).

3. **PreviousInteractions**
   - A list of fully-completed question-response pairs from the past.
   - Each interaction has exactly one user prompt and exactly one “final” response (which can be text, an image, or an error).
   - Useful for reconstructing the entire conversation history.
   - Additional optional fields:
     - **Timestamp** to note when the interaction happened or completed.
     - **Usage** to note the token usage or cost for that interaction.
     - **Model** to note which model was used at the time (if you allow model-switching).

4. **CurrentInteraction**
   - An object that holds the in-progress conversation turn.
   - Often, the user tries something, sees the response, maybe modifies the question, re-sends it, etc. – that means multiple *attempts* within the same “turn” or “interaction window.”
   - Once the user is satisfied and “closes out” that turn, you could move the final (prompt, response) to **PreviousInteractions**, or you could choose to store them all in `PreviousInteractions` but mark them differently.

5. **Attempts**
   - Each element is one sub-step of the current interaction.
   - For each attempt, store the user’s prompt and the AI’s response.
   - The response can have a **Type** indicating text, image, or an error.
   - After repeated attempts, the user might finalize one of them or discard them all.

6. **UserDraft**
   - Represents what the user is *currently typing* but has not yet submitted.
   - If the user “finishes” typing and clicks “send,” that text goes into a new attempt in **CurrentInteraction** (and the `UserDraft` is cleared).
   - The `Type` field says whether the user intends to generate text or an image.

### Possible Extras You Might Want

- **Timestamps everywhere**: If you need a precise log, store date-times for each attempt, each user input, each final response, etc.
- **Token usage**: If you want to track how many tokens or how much cost each attempt used (especially for GPT-4 usage tracking), add a `Usage` object to each attempt.
- **Metadata**: Model name, conversation title, ephemeral flags (e.g. “draft,” “archived,” or “starred”).
- **Unique IDs for attempts**: Some apps store an internal ID for each prompt-response pair in case you need to identify them or re-render them selectively.

---

This structure should be more than enough to cover:

- Persisting your system messages in a single place (immutable mid-conversation).
- Storing a permanent chronological log of user prompts and AI responses.
- Handling both text and image requests.
- Handling partial or multi-attempt interactions in progress.
- Capturing the user’s current, unsent draft.

Feel free to tailor it further based on any additional constraints or requirements in your app!
