Below is an example JSON schema for a **turn-based** approach where **each attempt** has its **own user input** *and* a corresponding assistant response. This design allows you to retain the original prompt and the AI’s initial response, while also capturing any subsequent revised prompts (and their responses) in the same *logical* turn or “theme” of the conversation.

```jsonc
{
  "conversationId": "a-unique-ID-or-GUID",

  // High-level metadata or settings for this conversation
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Optional conversation title",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-10T12:34:56Z",
    "model": "gpt-4"
  },

  // System messages, if needed. (Optional)
  "systemMessages": [
    {
      "content": "Instruction #1"
    },
    {
      "content": "Instruction #2"
    }
  ],

  // The conversation is divided into 'turns' or 'topics', each containing
  // multiple attempts. A "turn" might represent the user’s focus on one
  // question or request, where they can revise that question multiple times.
  "turns": [
    {
      "turnId": 1,
      // The 'attempts' array has *each* user prompt, followed by the assistant’s response.
      "attempts": [
        {
          "attemptId": 1,
          "userInput": {
            "type": "text",            // or "image"
            "content": "First prompt here",
            "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:35:00Z"
          },
          "assistantResponse": {
            "type": "text",            // or "image" | "error"
            "content": "AI’s first response",
            "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:35:10Z"
          },
          // 'status' can reflect if user found it unsatisfactory or had an error
          "status": "discarded"        // "accepted", "error", "discarded"...
        },
        {
          "attemptId": 2,
          "userInput": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "Second attempt with revised prompt",
            "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:36:00Z"
          },
          "assistantResponse": {
            "type": "text",
            "content": "AI’s second response (better answer)",
            "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:36:10Z"
          },
          "status": "accepted"
        }
      ]
    },
    // Additional turns, each can have its own set of attempts.
    {
      "turnId": 2,
      "attempts": [
        {
          "attemptId": 1,
          "userInput": {
            "type": "image",
            "content": "User requests an image of a cat wearing a hat",
            "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:40:00Z"
          },
          "assistantResponse": {
            "type": "image",
            // This could be base64, a file path, or a reference ID
            "content": "Base64 data or image path here",
            "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:40:05Z"
          },
          "status": "accepted"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],

  // If the user is currently typing (hasn't hit "Send"), store their draft:
  "userDraft": {
    "type": "text", // or "image"
    "content": "User's partial input here"
  }
}
```

## Why This Structure?

1. **Each Attempt Holds Its Own User Input**
   - This preserves the history of every revised prompt without losing the original.
   - You can see exactly how the user changed their question and how the AI responded each time.

2. **Turn-Based Grouping**
   - A “turn” can represent the user’s overall goal or topic. Within that, you can have multiple attempts as the user refines or corrects their question.
   - If you prefer, you can skip the notion of “turns” and keep a simple list of attempts. But grouping helps semantically when multiple prompts revolve around the same final outcome.

3. **Status for Each Attempt**
   - `"accepted"`: The user was satisfied (or at least wants to keep this result).
   - `"discarded"`: The user changed their mind or the answer was unhelpful.
   - `"error"`: The request or the AI’s response encountered an error.
   - You can define more statuses if needed.

4. **Multiple Content Types (Text, Image, Error)**
   - Storing `type` for both user input and assistant response makes it easy to handle different modes of generation.
   - Error handling is just another type or status in each attempt.

5. **Draft Field**
   - Helps you restore unsent user input if the app is closed or the user takes a long break.

6. **Easy to Extend**
   - Want to track usage tokens, cost, or additional metadata? You can add fields like `"tokenUsage"` at the attempt or turn level.
   - You can add new properties without disrupting the main structure.

In short, this schema allows you to keep **each user revision** and **the AI response** in a neat “attempt” record while grouping them by a logical “turn,” giving you the best of both worlds.
