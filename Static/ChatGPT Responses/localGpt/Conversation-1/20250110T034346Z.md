Below is a **simplified** approach for your WPF controls, focusing on a **single dropdown** to select which past exchange is being replaced, and one list box to show the **current attempts**. This avoids a full “branch” concept—just pick one exchange from the past, generate attempts, and either finalize or discard them.

---

## Control Names & Descriptions

1. **cmbRewriteTarget** (ComboBox)
   - **Purpose**: Above the “current attempts” area, the user picks **which exchange** they want to replace (e.g., “Latest” or “Exchange #5”).
   - By default, this is set to **“Latest”**, so new attempts will become the next exchange in normal chronological order.
   - If the user tries to change the selection, warn them: *“Changing the target will remove all current attempts and drafts. Are you sure?”*

2. **lstCurrentAttempts** (ListBox)
   - **Purpose**: Shows any attempts that have been generated for the **currently selected rewrite target**.
   - Each item in this list corresponds to one attempt (User Prompt -> AI Response).
   - You can use DataTemplates to handle text vs. image vs. error, just like you would elsewhere.

3. **txtUserDraft** (TextBox)
   - **Purpose**: Where the user types the next prompt for the **current** rewrite attempts.
   - If they click “Generate Attempt,” your code calls the API and appends a new attempt to `lstCurrentAttempts`.
   - If a blackout happens, you can reload this partial text from the JSON `currentExchange.userDraft`.

4. **btnGenerateAttempt** (Button)
   - **Purpose**: Sends the text from `txtUserDraft` to the AI (OpenAI API) for a new attempt.
   - The resulting attempt is added to `lstCurrentAttempts`.
   - Clears `txtUserDraft` afterward (optional, depending on your design).

5. **btnAcceptRewrite** (Button)
   - **Purpose**: Finalizes the rewrite. In other words:
     1. Delete all finalized exchanges **after** the chosen exchange in `cmbRewriteTarget`.
     2. Insert a new finalized exchange using whichever attempt the user selects (or the last attempt in `lstCurrentAttempts`) as the official “reply.”
     3. Clear the current attempts and user draft.
   - Essentially, “Yes, rewrite from that chosen point, and use this new attempt as the final #6 (or whichever).”

6. **btnDiscardRewrite** (Button)
   - **Purpose**: Cancels everything in the current rewrite session.
   - Keeps the existing timeline intact, ignoring the new attempts in `lstCurrentAttempts`.
   - Clears `lstCurrentAttempts` and `txtUserDraft`.
   - Resets `cmbRewriteTarget` to “Latest,” or to its original selection, depending on your design.

## Example XAML (Conceptual)

Below is a **conceptual layout** to illustrate how these controls might appear. Adjust it to fit your actual UI style and layout.

```xml
<Window x:Class="LocalGptApp.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        Title="Local GPT App" Width="800" Height="500">

    <StackPanel Margin="10" Orientation="Vertical">

        <!-- Label + ComboBox for choosing which exchange to rewrite. -->
        <TextBlock Text="Rewrite From Exchange:" FontWeight="Bold" Margin="0,0,0,5"/>
        <ComboBox Name="cmbRewriteTarget"
                  Width="200"
                  SelectionChanged="cmbRewriteTarget_SelectionChanged"
                  Margin="0,0,0,10">
            <!-- In practice, you’ll bind ItemsSource to a collection of exchange references. -->
            <ComboBoxItem Content="Latest" Tag="latest" IsSelected="True"/>
            <ComboBoxItem Content="Exchange #1" Tag="1"/>
            <ComboBoxItem Content="Exchange #2" Tag="2"/>
            <ComboBoxItem Content="Exchange #3" Tag="3"/>
            <!-- etc. -->
        </ComboBox>

        <!-- Current attempts list box -->
        <TextBlock Text="Current Attempts:" FontWeight="Bold"/>
        <ListBox Name="lstCurrentAttempts" Height="200" Margin="0,0,0,10">
            <!-- You can define an ItemTemplate for text/image/error as needed. -->
        </ListBox>

        <!-- Draft prompt and buttons -->
        <TextBlock Text="Draft Prompt:" FontWeight="Bold"/>
        <TextBox Name="txtUserDraft"
                 Height="60"
                 TextWrapping="Wrap"
                 Margin="0,0,0,10"
                 VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto"/>

        <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" HorizontalAlignment="Left">
            <Button Name="btnGenerateAttempt"
                    Content="Generate Attempt"
                    Width="120"
                    Margin="0,0,10,0"/>
            <Button Name="btnAcceptRewrite"
                    Content="Accept Rewrite"
                    Width="120"
                    Margin="0,0,10,0"/>
            <Button Name="btnDiscardRewrite"
                    Content="Discard Rewrite"
                    Width="120"/>
        </StackPanel>
    </StackPanel>
</Window>
```

### Behavior Summary

1. **cmbRewriteTarget**
   - A user picks “Latest,” or “Exchange #1,” or “Exchange #5,” etc.
   - On selection change, you ask for confirmation:
     > “Changing the rewrite target will remove all current attempts and drafts. Continue?”
   - If user says “Yes,” clear out `lstCurrentAttempts` and `txtUserDraft`, set up the new target context in your data model.
   - If “No,” revert the combo selection to what it was.

2. **txtUserDraft** + **btnGenerateAttempt**
   - The user types a new prompt in `txtUserDraft`.
   - Clicking “Generate Attempt” calls your API to get a response, which appears in `lstCurrentAttempts`.

3. **btnAcceptRewrite**
   - The user selects or implies which attempt in `lstCurrentAttempts` they want to finalize.
   - Your code does:
     - Removes all finalized exchanges **after** the chosen index in `cmbRewriteTarget`.
     - Creates a new exchange with `UserRequest` = the user prompt, `AssistantReply` = the chosen attempt’s response.
     - Clears out the current attempts and draft.
     - Resets or leaves `cmbRewriteTarget` as “Latest.”

4. **btnDiscardRewrite**
   - The user abandons rewriting.
   - No changes are made to the existing conversation.
   - `lstCurrentAttempts` and `txtUserDraft` are cleared.
   - Resets `cmbRewriteTarget` to “Latest” (or the last official exchange) for a normal flow.

## Final Control Name List

- **cmbRewriteTarget**
- **lstCurrentAttempts**
- **txtUserDraft**
- **btnGenerateAttempt**
- **btnAcceptRewrite**
- **btnDiscardRewrite**

These names should keep things **clear and concise**. You have a single dropdown to pick the rewrite target, a list to display attempts, and straightforward buttons for generating, accepting, or discarding attempts. This design is simpler to implement and use than a full “git-branch-like” approach.
