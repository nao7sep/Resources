Below are **plain-English** suggestions for button names and their purposes. Each name focuses on clarity, so that anyone reading the code or the UI can quickly understand what the button does.

1. **Delete Exchanges from Selected Forward**
   - **Name**: `btnDeleteExchangesFromSelected`
   - **Purpose**: Deletes the currently selected exchange (in a list) **and** all subsequent exchanges in the timeline.

2. **Clear Current Attempts**
   - **Name**: `btnClearCurrentAttempts`
   - **Purpose**: Empties the list of attempts in the current (in-progress) interaction, discarding any partial or undesired attempts.

3. **Clear Draft**
   - **Name**: `btnClearDraft`
   - **Purpose**: Empties the user’s draft text box (the user’s partially typed prompt).

4. **Change Auto-Save Path**
   - **Name**: `btnChangeAutoSavePath`
   - **Purpose**: Opens a file dialog (or similar) allowing the user to set a new path or filename for auto-saving the JSON file.

5. **Generate File Name**
   - **Name**: `btnGenerateFileName`
   - **Purpose**: Opens a dialog box where the app proposes a filename (based on conversation content). The user can accept it, ask for another suggestion, or cancel.

6. **Discard Selected Attempts**
   - **Name**: `btnDiscardSelectedAttempts`
   - **Purpose**: Removes one or more attempts that the user manually selects from the current or past attempts list (if your UI allows multi-select). This is for quickly clearing out attempts they’re confident they won’t need.

### Other Possible Buttons (Optional Ideas)

- **Open Conversation File**
  - **Name**: `btnOpenConversationFile`
  - **Purpose**: Opens a file dialog to load an existing JSON conversation.

- **Save Conversation**
  - **Name**: `btnSaveConversation`
  - **Purpose**: Manually triggers a “save” to the current path (even if auto-save is on, sometimes the user wants a quick manual save).

- **Refresh Translations**
  - **Name**: `btnRefreshTranslations`
  - **Purpose**: If your app supports generating translations automatically, a button could prompt the AI to regenerate or update translations for the selected exchange(s).

- **Finalize Current Exchange**
  - **Name**: `btnFinalizeCurrentExchange`
  - **Purpose**: Moves the last chosen prompt/response pair into the official “exchanges” list, clearing the current in-progress attempts.

These names are **concise** and **descriptive**, making it clear what action each button performs in the UI and in your code.
