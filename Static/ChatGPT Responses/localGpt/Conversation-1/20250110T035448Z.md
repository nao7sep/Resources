Below are **plain-English, WPF-friendly control names** and short explanations of their usage for managing the **original language** and the **target translation languages**—all while the app transparently handles background translation.

1. **ComboBox: Choose Original (Main) Language**
   - **Name**: `cmbOriginalLanguage`
   - **Purpose**: The user selects the **primary language** in which the AI’s final replies should appear (e.g., “English”).
   - Because your AI is capable of understanding any input language, this combo box simply defines *the language for the assistant’s replies.*

2. **ListBox (or similar) of Target Translation Languages**
   - **Name**: `lstTargetLanguages`
   - **Purpose**: Displays a list of **target languages** into which the conversation’s content should be translated.
   - The user can add or remove languages in this list, and the background translation process updates automatically.

3. **Button: Add a Target Language**
   - **Name**: `btnAddTargetLanguage`
   - **Purpose**: Opens a small dialog or presents a dropdown allowing the user to pick an additional language (from all available) to add to `lstTargetLanguages`.

4. **Button: Remove a Target Language**
   - **Name**: `btnRemoveTargetLanguage`
   - **Purpose**: Removes the selected item(s) from `lstTargetLanguages`.
   - The background translator thread will drop any existing translations in those languages.

5. **(Optional) Button: Apply Language Changes**
   - **Name**: `btnApplyLanguageChanges`
   - **Purpose**: If you prefer an “OK/Apply” flow—rather than instantly applying changes—this button finalizes the newly selected `original language` and `target languages`.
   - If you handle changes immediately (e.g., as soon as the user modifies the list), you might not need this.

### Where to Place These Controls

- **`cmbOriginalLanguage`** near the top of a settings panel or a small “Language Settings” dialog.
- **`lstTargetLanguages`** next to or below it, so the user can see at a glance which translations are active.
- **`btnAddTargetLanguage`** and **`btnRemoveTargetLanguage`** near or below the list box.

### Behavior in the App

1. **Original Language**
   - Whatever the user picks here tells the assistant (and your system) to produce final replies in that language.
   - If the user changes it, your system might re-translate or re-generate some text in the new “original” language for consistency.

2. **Target Languages**
   - If the user **adds** a new language, your background translation process quietly generates translations of existing finalized exchanges (and future ones) into that new language.
   - If the user **removes** a language, your background translator thread **deletes** or discards stored translations for that language.

3. **No Manual “Translate Now”**
   - Everything is done automatically in the background.
   - The user only chooses which languages they want to see (or keep) translations for, without needing to manually trigger translation.

### Summary of Names

- **`cmbOriginalLanguage`** – Select the main language for AI responses.
- **`lstTargetLanguages`** – The set of languages the conversation will be translated into in the background.
- **`btnAddTargetLanguage`** – Add a language to the translation list.
- **`btnRemoveTargetLanguage`** – Remove a language from the translation list.
- **`btnApplyLanguageChanges`** (optional) – Confirm/commit changes if needed.

By keeping these names clear and descriptive, you ensure both developers and end users can easily follow the app’s language-related controls.
